# Flappy Bird Clone

This is a simple JavaScript-based clone of the classic Flappy Bird game. The game runs on an HTML5 `canvas` and uses basic JavaScript for game logic, physics, and rendering.


## How to Play

1. Press the spacebar or tap the screen to make the bird flap and rise.

2. The bird will fall due to gravity, so you need to keep tapping to prevent it from hitting the ground.

3. Avoid the green pipes! The objective is to fly as far as possible without colliding with them.

4. Your score increases by one point every time you successfully navigate past a pipe.


## Game Features

- **Gravity:** The bird constantly falls due to gravity, and you need to press the spacebar (or tap) to flap and counter the fall.

- **Pipes:** The game generates a series of pipes with gaps through which the bird must fly.

- **Score:** Every time the bird successfully passes through a pipe, the score increases by 1.

- **Game Over:** The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or falls to the ground.

- **Restart:** After a game over, you can restart the game by pressing the Restart button.


## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in your browser.

## Customizations

- **Background:** Since I'm not great at drawing, I haven't added a background image yet. But if you'd like to add one, please feel free to create an image and I‚Äôll gladly add it! Just let me know.

- **Game Mechanics:** The gravity, flap force, spawn rate of pipes, and pipe gap size are all customizable. Feel free to tweak the constants at the top of the script to adjust the difficulty or game dynamics.


## Credits

- **Bird emoji:** Used for the bird character (üïäÔ∏è), because I'm not an artist and it fits the theme!
